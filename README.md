# Glasscubes help for TLM staff

Originally a data permissions catalogue, documenting design patterns for personal data sharing, with example uses and research. Maintained by [IF](https://projectsbyif.com/). It has since been repurposed as a quick and flexible help file for TLM staff to work out where things are on their new intranet.

## How to contribute

1. Clone this repository.

2. In the ``_posts`` folder, create a new Markdown file with the current date and the name of the new pattern separated by dashes. For example, if it's 31 August 2016 and the new pattern is called "New Permissions Pattern", the file will be called ``2016-08-31-new-permissions-pattern.markdown``.

3. Copy and paste in the template below, change the title, add a description and some links to examples, if they exist.

  ```
  ---
  title:  "New permissions pattern"
  ---

  This is a description of the new permissions pattern.
