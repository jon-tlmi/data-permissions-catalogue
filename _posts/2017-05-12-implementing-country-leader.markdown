Your main responsibilities are to your country site and to make sure your country is up to date in some areas under the Global Fellowship workspace.

### Want to check up on your funding countries?

### Are you a member of a MAWG?
* There may be a dedicated MAWG workspace which you can't see. If you're not a member of it, you can't see it so please contact the MAWG convener to make sure you have access to everything you need
