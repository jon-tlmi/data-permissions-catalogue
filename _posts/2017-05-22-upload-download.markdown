![These are some files in a folder](https://jon-tlmi.github.io/glasscubes-help/images/file-folder-view.png)
There are a few methods open to you: 
  * Use the Options button to the right of the file and select download.
  * Use the checkboxes to the right of options to select one or more files and use the download button that appears above the file listing. (Easy to download multiple files this way)

### Upload a file
* Make sure you know where your file currently is.
* Find out where you should be uploading your file to on Glasscubes and navigate to it so you can see the folder on your screen.
* Look for a big blue button on the right side of the screen which says 'Upload files'. Click on it, slect your file and it will be uploaded to that folder
* If you don't have a button which says 'Upload files' you don't have permission to do so. Please contact the workspace owner to gain permission
