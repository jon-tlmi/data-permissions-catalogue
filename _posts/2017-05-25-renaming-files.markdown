title:  "How do I rename this file?"

How do I rename a file which is already on Glasscubes? This is slightly counter-intuitive, but useful if you are correcting a file name (or just describing the file better..)

### Renaming an already uploaded file
* Can you see the file name in the top left?
* Click on the name in the top left
* Type the new name in
* Press enter
* If you click on the file name and nothing happens, you may not have permission to rename files. Contact the workspace owner
