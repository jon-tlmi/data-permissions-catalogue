title:  "How do I rename this file?"

How do I rename a file which is already on Glasscubes? This is slightly counter-intuitive, but useful if you are correcting a file name (or just describing the file better..)

### Renaming an already uploaded file
* Click on the file until you see the preview view, with the comments and info on the right.
* Click on the file name in the top left
* Type the new name in
* Press enter (on your keyboard, there's nothing on screen!)
  * A small information highlight should tell you've successfully renamed the file, then fade away.
* If you click on the file name and nothing happens, you may not have permission to rename files. Contact the workspace owner
