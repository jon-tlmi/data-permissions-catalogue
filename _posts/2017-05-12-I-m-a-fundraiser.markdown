You're a fundraiser and you'd like to find some case studies or photos or maybe check out our brand guidelines? Perhaps you want to talk something over with other fundraisers?

### Photos and Case studies
* Photos and case study materials are now on [ResourceSpace](https://leprosymission.resourcespace.com/)
* We have moved our photos away from Flickr

### Branding and other GF-wide standards
* Brand guidelines belong to the whole Global Fellowship, so they can be found in the Global Fellowship workspace under [communications, image and branding](https://tlmi.glasscubes.com/cube/documents/128238/453360)

### Want to talk/discuss with other Fundraisers?
* There is a dedicated fundraising workspace which is available. If you're not a member of it, you can't see it. If you think you should be a member of it, please contact Jon 

### What's our impact?
* You can check out our [Key Performance Indicators and other outputs](https://tlmi.glasscubes.com/cube/documents/128238/453362?149). They're under the Global Fellowship workspace, in the [monitoring, evaluation and learning](https://tlmi.glasscubes.com/cube/documents/128238/494659?152) folder

### What about campaign materials?
* The Fundraising Working Group is consulting with people as to where the best place is for this. ResourceSpace can hold the materials but is unable to host discussions. At the moment we're using Glasscubes to discuss campaign materials - in the Fundraisers workspace. We are very open to hearing your thoughts.
