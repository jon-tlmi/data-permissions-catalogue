You're a fundraiser and you'd like to find some case studies or photos or maybe check out our brand guidelines? Perhaps you want to talk something over with other fundraisers?

### Photos and Case studies
* Photos can be found on [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/tlmi)
* They will soon be moving to ResourceSpace along with our case studies.

### Branding and other GF-wide standards
* Brand guidelines belong to the whole Global Fellowship, so they can be found in the Global Fellowship workspace under [communications, image and branding].(https://tlmi.glasscubes.com/cube/documents/128238/453360)

### Want to talk/discuss with other Fundraisers?
* There is a dedicated fundraising workspace which is available. If you're not a member of it, you can't see it. If you think you should be a member of it, please contact Jon
