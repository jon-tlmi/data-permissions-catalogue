You're a fundraiser and you'd like to find some case studies or photos or maybe check out our brand guidelines? Perhaps you want to talk something over with other fundraisers?

### Photos and Case studies
* Photos can be found on [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/tlmi)
* They will soon be moving to ResourceSpace along with our case studies.

### Branding and other GF-wide standards
* Brand guidelines belong to the whole Global Fellowship, so they can be found in the Global Fellowship workspace under [communications, image and branding](https://tlmi.glasscubes.com/cube/documents/128238/453360)

### Want to talk/discuss with other Fundraisers?
* There is a dedicated fundraising workspace which is available. If you're not a member of it, you can't see it. If you think you should be a member of it, please contact Jon 

### What's our impact?
* You can check out our [Key Performance Indicators and other outputs](https://tlmi.glasscubes.com/cube/documents/128238/453362?149). They're under the Global Fellowship workspace, in the [monitoring, evaluation and learning](https://tlmi.glasscubes.com/cube/documents/128238/494659?152) folder

### What about campaign materials?
* At the moment Heather is consulting with people as to where the best place is for this. I think we're leaning towards using Glasscubes - in the Fundraisers workspace. Please let people know if you're going to be putting things there and of course, Heather would very much like to hear your thoughts.
