title:  "General info - where is everything?"
---
I'm sorry everything seems so confusing. I'll try to unpack some of the thinking and conversations that have gone into the design of Glasscubes.

### Workspaces? What are they? 
* Glasscubes is the name of the software we're using to share documents across the Global Fellowship. It is divided into seperate workspaces. If you can see a workspace you have access to it. The default level of access is called 'read only' which means you can see the information and download files. If you need to get more access so you can do more (e.g. upload files, make changes) you can ask the workspace 'owner'. Their name should be on the Summary page of the workspace. If it's not, let [Jon](mailto:it@leprosymission.org) know. 

### What's this Global Fellowship workspace?
* The Global Fellowship(GF) is the name we've given to mean 'all the TLM non-profits around the globe that have signed up to a charter agreeing to work together'. All the files that relate to more than one country should be in the space. It is one of the main workspaces of Glasscubes. One example would be Member reviews, which is when people from TLM come and help another TLM review their work in a constructive way. These reports are then available so others can see the process and learn from it.

### What's this Prayer workspace?
* The Leprosy Mission is possible only with God's help and prayer is so important we've dedicated a workspace to it. Everyone should have read access to it. We have a team of people who will be uploading prayer requests, praise and thank yous. If you want to be a part of this team, let the workspace owner know.

### Why doesn't country X have a workspace?
* At the moment supporting countries don't, automatically, have workspaces. Their contributions are mostly found under the Global Fellowship, such as their strategies, funding reports and so on. 
* Implementing countries get their own workspaces because it allows people to chose which countries they can follow with notifications. If you only fund one country, you can restrict the amount of notifications you can get. Some implementing countries can generate a large amount of notifications due to their size.
* Alternatively some countries have requested a 'private' workspace which only their staff can use. If you suspect this is the case and believe you should be given access, please contact the country leader.
