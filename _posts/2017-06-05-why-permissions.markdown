title:  "Why can't I change permissions?"
---
If you can't change the permissions on a file or folder it's because you don't have permissions. Only workspace owners can change permissions on folders and only the owners of files can change it's permissions. 

### Use the options button to change the permissions on a file or folder
*  Contact the workspace owner if you think the permissions on an object are wrong.
