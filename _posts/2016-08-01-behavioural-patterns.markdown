Access is allowed if a someones activity matches past behaviour. For example, a card transaction might be declined if used somewhere the user doesn't usually go to.

### Examples
* Online bank transfer declined sent to an account they've not sent to before
* Facebook blocks a login attempt if it comes from an IP the person doesn't usually visit from
* LastPass declines access to the service when it's accessed from abroad. A link is sent to the account holder by email to confirm the attempt was legitimate
