title:  "Emergency access"
---

A person gives someone else they trust the authority to act on their behalf in an emergency by issuing them with an access code in advance. The trusted person can use the code to access the other person's data in an emergency, but only after a set period of time has elapsed (during which there is the opportunity to veto access).
