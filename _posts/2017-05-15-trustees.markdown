title:  "What about my trustees?"
---
If you're a leader who needs to share with trustees who are not TLM staff members, you currently have two choices - have a chat with the TLMI staff if you absolutely have to make your trustees part of the Glasscubes experience. Alternatively, if you just want to share a folder which has all their files in it, you can share a folder with them publicly. 
### Diferences between sharing rather than joining Glasscubes
* Shared folder: Trustees don't need to login (although you can password protect it if an oscure link isn't good enough)
* Shared folder: We don't need to manage their licences
* Glasscubes: We need to manage licences for them
* Glasscubes: Trustees will be able to see all conversations and activity on the Workspace

### Share a folder 
* You can make a folder in your country workspace. Make sure it's clearly named as Trustees will be able to see this name.
* When you see this folder in your workspace, to the right of it you will see an 'Options' button. 
* Clicking on this reveals a menu and at the top is 'Share this folder'. 
* After clicking to share the folder, you can use the 'Copy share link' to get the link to send to your trustees. 
  * Optionally you can also password protect and/or set an expiry date so that it will stop being shared after a certain point.
* Important note: This method is limited to one-way communications. Trustees will not be able to upload or make changes to files shared in this way.
