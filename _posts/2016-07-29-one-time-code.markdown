title:  "One-time code"
---

A person can generate a unique code that allows a third-party to access their data at a set point in time. The code can only be used once. It is up to the person who generated the code how they deliver it to the third-party.

A one-time code cannot prevent saving/screen capture of data by the person using the code.
