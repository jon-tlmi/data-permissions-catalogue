title:  "Notifications are flooding my inbox!"
---
The good news is you are popular or following a lot of things. It's also good news a lot of people are using Glasscubes. The bad news is that you may be getting too many notifications sent to you.

### You are in control of your notifications
* Click on your picture (or your initials) in the top right of the browser window - it should be to the left of the bell-like notification icon. When you mouse hovers over it, it will say 'Your profile'. 
* Now you're looking at your profile, you can update it and maybe add a photo?
* On the upper right hand side, you will see some buttons, including 'Reset my password' and other options. 
* Click on the button that says 'Notification Preferences'.
* In the Notifications Settings area there are two tabs
  * Settings allows you to change how you are informed by email.
  * Items following allows you to see what items (particularly files you've uploaded) you are following - so you get updates if anything happens to them.
* Near the bottom of the page is a text link which says 'Show workspace subscription and notification settings' - click on this for more settings
* You can explore the settings under 'Show workspace subscription and notification settings' for yourself, but if you click on the 'Workspace Summary' tab, you can choose to get Daily, Weekly or None for your notifications settings which will greatly cut down on the amount of notifications you get (but you may miss out!)
