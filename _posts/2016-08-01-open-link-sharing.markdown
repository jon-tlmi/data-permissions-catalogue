title:  "Open link sharing"
---

A link to data is generated and shared with those who have permission to access it. Sometimes the link is delisted from search engines to prevent other people from discovering it. No further authentication is needed when the link is accessed.

### Examples
* Google Docs: share with anyone that has link
* Etherpad
* Keybase file system
