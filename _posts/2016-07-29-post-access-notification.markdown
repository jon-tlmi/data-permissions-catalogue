title:  "Post-access notification"
---

Some services require a forced update to someone's data, followed by a notification that it has occurred so that they have an opportunity to appeal. An example of this is if points for speeding need to be added to someone's driving licence.

### Examples
* Driving licence points
* Land Registry property alerts
