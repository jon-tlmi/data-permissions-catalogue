title:  "What are the access levels?"
---
Glasscubes is all about sharing, and much like sharing with your brothers and sisters, there need to be rules.

### Workspaces? What are they? 
* Glasscubes is the name of the software we're using to share documents across the Global Fellowship. It is divided into seperate workspaces. If you can see a workspace you have access to it.

### Access levels? User types? What are they? 
* __You can have different access levels for each of the workspaces you have access to__. Each workspace has at least one 'owner' who will determine the right level of access for you. If you think you need more or less access, you can contact them.
* The default level of access is called 'read only' which means you can see the information and download files. If you need to get more access so you can do more (e.g. upload files, make changes) you can ask the workspace 'owner'. Their name should be on the Summary page of the workspace. If it's not, let [Jon](mailto:it@leprosymission.org) know. 
* The next level up from 'read only' is 'comment only'. These people are allowed to make comments on documents and reply to posts, but can't upload new files of their own. They also can't start discussions on the summary page, for instance. Comment only users will see 'read only' instead of upload buttons in the Files section.
* The next level up from 'comment only' is contributor. They can upload files, start conversations and create folders.
* Workspace owners are awesome people with magical powers to grant others permissions and set permissions on folders, even those created by other people. Please be very nice to them as they have to balance the needs of everyone across the workspace (not just you, sorry!).
